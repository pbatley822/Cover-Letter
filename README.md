To whom it may concern:

I greatly appreciate your consideration and your time. I am excited to learn more about an opportunity to work with you.

I have a strong background in Customer Service that has enabled me to be successful in many situations. My most recent job at Fry's Electronics has taught me a lot about troubleshooting and problem solving with customers over the phone. In conjunction with answering standard queries like product availability and general store questions, I aid customers in specific product questions, ordering questions or issues and sometimes, although my fellow associates and I are not officially trained to do so, technical support. 

I often have to research an issue very quickly to provide the customer with adequate information, ensuring that I have assisted them to their satisfaction, and move on to the next customer. Through this process I have learned to handle stressful situations with ease. When I have many customers that are calling in, it's my job to assist them in a timely manner to prevent long wait times and dropped calls. 

In addition to phone support, I also assist customers through our CRM system, Sugar. While answering emails does not require as great a sense of urgency as phone calls, the problems are often more complex and can require specific and precise responses. This has enabled me to learn how to be more effective with my research and communication.

I am also mechanically capable. I have successfully built my own desktop computer, purchasing and assembling all the parts. Preliminarily, I loaded the Ubuntu 14.04LTS interface to explore my new desktop. I then installed an additional hard drive to which I loaded the technical preview of Windows 10. Currently, I have upgraded the desktop to include a discrete graphics card enabling faster and higher quality graphics output over the integrated, CPU based graphics. This has allowed me to fully test many different applications in the beta operating system. 

Additionally, I have experience setting up my own home wired and wireless network. Currently, I have routed the wired connection from the cable provider's supplied modem/router and sent the connection to a different part of the house utilizing a power-line adapter. I found this to be very useful as I am now able to connect several devices through the faster, lower interference, wired connection. I also created an extended network with the two existing access points, allowing for a seamless transition between them. 

Overall, I am a very capable and bright young man looking to excel at everything I put my mind to. I will be a great asset to any team. 

Again, thank you for your time and consideration. 

Kind Regards,
Paul Batley
